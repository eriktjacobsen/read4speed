==========

Speed Reader implemented in: jQuery / Bootstrap3 

![Example Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ocmcsBq.png)

This is first version done in one day, 
still need to implement custom timings and wrapping it into a bookmarklet / chrome add-on

Non-standard Features:
* Context Hover, lets you pause reading and view long-form to gain context around word.
* Slider in context to jump to specific place in text.
* Preview / Review toggle, increases time each word is on the screen and in your periphery

Please take a look as I continue to add features and design.
